This project consists of two requirements, the first requirement depends on the graph.txt file,
which uses the information in the file to create the graph and then applies the Dikjstra algorithms 
on the graph that has already been made. We will do Dikjstra algorithm V times ( number of vertices) every time 
the DBAllSourceSPAlg class  will send new source to SingleSourcePatj Class that contain the Dikjstra algorithm, 
Then the method of algorithm will generate the shortest path algorithm.
The second Requirement is creating a graph depending on specific choices.
and then applied the Dikjstra algorithms to the graph.
